    <p>Ah, so what a scene, let's do another toast to confine</p>
    <p>Match a city, overflowing laughing voices are</p>
    <p>Pretended fabrications of a lie, blinded eye, deception</p>
    <p>I'm trying not to go mad</p>
    <br><p>Could a, could an aroma come and feed the brain in tune</p>
    <p>With stimulation, reawaken inclinations</p>
    <p>Don't know who's gonna go there today, I wonder</p>
    <br><p>If I kept trying then, what can I, that cannot be done</p>
    <p>On to the world, what can I, that cannot be done</p>
    <p>Looking in those dark little eyes, I decide</p>
    <p>I need to not once let your tear fall beneath</p>
    <br><p>Get out to find it now, don't ever let go</p>
    <p>The brighter future knows to reach it</p>
    <p>Even when the world is caught and full of wrong</p>
    <p>Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once</p>
    <p>No, I cannot be hurting no one</p>
    <p>I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now</p>
    <p>Woken to resume my need to stay the real me</p>
    <br><p>So what a scene, here's to another safely passed time</p>
    <p>Masking every new bad rumor flowing in the city</p>
    <p>Feel the lie, feel the lie, release to turn a blind eye</p>
    <p>Choking on their own hysteria</p>
    <br><p>Marching with an innocence, they proceed</p>
    <p>To a location echoing the sound of feet skipping and</p>
    <p>Feeling high, feeling high, memories of a lasting flavor</p>
    <p>The other side's insanity</p>
    <br><p>Can you call the "standard good" a living at all</p>
    <p>And can "nobody feeling sadder" be a living at all</p>
    <p>How is a straighter path you could see a living at all</p>
    <p>So let's imagine going "no mistake" as living at all</p>
    <p>And I don't wanna live as you'd assume, be saying it's right</p>
    <p>And artificially be living and you're saying it's right</p>
    <p>I don't know what I'll be, and to believe this, I wonder</p>
    <p>Want to know the truth, what I'm inside and under</p>
    <p>Oh, spill me the tale</p>
    <p>Oh, spill me the tale</p>
    <br><p>Still, we reside inside a dry confusing big world</p>
    <p>I make a wish alone</p>
    <p>Believe it, I just wanna be with you forever</p>
    <p>Give me hope to be just smiling with you again</p>
    <br><p>The skipping beating in my heart</p>
    <p>Is shaking me within, and begins to shout</p>
    <p>"Now you got to move, go make the way”</p>
    <br><p>I will rise to prove the fragile little "myself"</p>
    <p>Go bite into my own and reach it</p>
    <p>Even when the world is caught, and full of wrong</p>
    <p>Keep needing ya to laugh and be free for once</p>
    <p>No, I cannot see nobody cry</p>
    <p>I wanted, I wanted to be stronger now</p>
    <p>Woken to resume my need to stay the real me</p>
    <br><p>I'm gonna keep ya from danger, there are too many</p>
    <p>I'm running, I'm running, I'm running for you</p>
    <p>I will overcome what is residing for you</p>
